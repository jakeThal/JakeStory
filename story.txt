The Waystone inn was in the middle of the town on Noware, in the middle of nowhere.  Inside the inn was a silence of three parts.  The first, a silence due to the lack of people.  The second due to the lack of external forces. But the third was almost undetectable.  One could sit there for hours and not notice it. The third, belonged to the innkeeper.
